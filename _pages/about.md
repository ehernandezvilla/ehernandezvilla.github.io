##### **From a young age, I've been captivated by technology and business. I had the chance to be part of the initial team at Easy Taxi Chile, one of the first successful ride-hailing apps in Chile and Latin America. I contributed to its launch and initial leadership in Santiago. Later, I relocated to Ecuador to assume the role of Country Manager. There, we faced the significant challenge of monetizing the operation and maturing the teams, adapting to various stages of growth. One of our most significant achievements was gaining the government's trust and becoming the official partners for private transportation security in the country.**

I then returned to Chile to lead operations and collaborate with the central team at Cabify & Easy Taxi during their merger and complete product migration for both riders and drivers. Despite the challenges, we successfully maintained high usage rates post-migration. My journey concluded with the relaunch and management of operations in Uruguay.

I have also been involved with other startups, such as Viapool, an Argentine MaaS company that expanded its operations to Chile and was later acquired by SWVL, a former mass mobility unicorn from the Middle East.

**Currently, I am dedicated to Bakslash, a consultancy that advises entrepreneurs and small businesses in bridging strategy and technology to drive their business growth in a straightforward and effective manner.**

On a temporary basis, I serve on boards related to tourism companies and family strategic projects, providing support in areas like expansion and analysis.

On a personal level, I love to improve myself, especially in technology projects involving programming. I'm a bit of a nerd, enjoy reading, and try to engage in sports whenever I can. I'm an animal lover and cherish my small family ❤️🙂👱‍♀️🐷.

From time to time I share content that has helped me or seems interesting and I think it could impact others 🚀🧠

**If you're interested in business opportunities, mentorships, or if you're an entrepreneur or small business in need of assistance, feel free to contact me. I'd be delighted to help if possible.**
